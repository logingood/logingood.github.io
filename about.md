Hi, my name is Murat Mukhtarov and I am DevOps engineer working at [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com). 

Recent trends in networking (SDN & NFV) and increasing containers popularity motivated me to start this blog where I am posting my proof of concept and integration research. I am really keen on programming, scripting and automation, as well as large-scale systems design. Especially my areas of interest IP/MPLS networks, DC networks, SDN, NFV, VM and Container environments.
